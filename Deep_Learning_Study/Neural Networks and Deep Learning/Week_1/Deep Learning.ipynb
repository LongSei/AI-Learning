    "- **Convolutional Neural Networks: (CNNs)**: Best suited for image processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Ideal for handling sequence data, such as audio clips or sentences, due to their temporal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid Neural Networks**: With require processing diverse data types, a combination or a custom architecture is used to handle multiple data sources and types efficiently.\n",
