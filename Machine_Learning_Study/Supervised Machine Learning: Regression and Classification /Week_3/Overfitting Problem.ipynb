    "### Overfitting vs. Underfitting\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: When a learning algorithm models the training data too closely, capturing noise along with the underlying pattern. It performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: Occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training data and new data.\n"

    "- **High Variance**: The model is excessively complex, capturing noise in the data as if it were a real pattern (overfitting).\n"
