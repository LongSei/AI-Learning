    "- **Definition**: Classification problems involve predicting an output variable **y** that can only take on a limited set of values, contrasting with linear regression's infinite range.\n",
    "- **Inadequacy of Linear Regression**: Linear regression is not suited for classification due to its continuous nature and inability to directly model binary outcomes.\n"

    "- **Binary Classification**: Involves predicting **y** with only two possible values (e.g., yes/no, true/false, 0/1).\n",

    "- **Terminology**: \n",
    "  - \"Class\" and \"category\" are used interchangeably.\n",
    "  - Common representations: no/yes, false/true, 0/1, with 0 often denoting the negative class (absence) and 1 the positive class (presence).\n",
    "  - **Negative and Positive Classes**: Context-based designation, not implying good or bad but absence (0) or presence (1) of a characteristic."
